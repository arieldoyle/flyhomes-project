## Project Description
### **OS:**
Flyhomes wants to host its own Linux-based file server to store sensitive information. The server must only be accessible to the executive team, who are non-technical Windows 10 users. Both the Windows 10 systems and Linux file server should be hosted from the same network and made remotely accessible. For their Windows 10 systems, the executives will need Gmail accounts associated with locally-installed Mozilla Thunderbird clients. The Linux shared folder should be automatically mounted as drive L: for the user.

Flyhomes executives are also needing a Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base with Containers instance deployed to AWS EC2 for a special project. You'll need to deploy this for them and establish an SOP for secure access for them.

### **Data:**
Each desktop should automatically backup both the user profiles and OS to the Linux file server. User profile backups should take place nightly, and OS-level backups should take place weekly.

### **Connectivity:**
The Windows 10 endpoint and Linux file server must be deployed to a shared LAN. Only the Windows 10 endpoint should be remotely accessible to the executive. Both systems should be remotely accessible to the MSP. The executives are non-technical users and will need GUI-based connectivity to Windows 10.
