## Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.
Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

### Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

#### Describe at least

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

__NOTE__: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

__Ariel Doyle__ - Documentation, Deployment/Imaging, Networking, and overall SysAdmin. Organization and group effort is key to this project, so I am willing to use my listed strengths and better my weaknesses (coding I am looking at you) and network mapping. I want to learn more about the cloud deployments and just work in a team setting on a project that is more than one person should handle. I will handle anything that needs to be handled or help another teammate when ever I am able to do so (daily).

__Justin Buffington__ - VMs (VirtualBox and AWS), networking (SSH and RDP), scripting (Bash and PowerShell), OS and software installation. For the project I can tackle- AWS implementation, Gmail and Thunderbird installation and association, and backups. I would like to develop more confidence in networking connections and firewall settings. I would like to approach the day-to-day by working individually or with a smaller team to tackle sections of the project as they come up.

__Joraya Flow__  - My individual strengths are system administration and setup and troubleshooting, documentation, coding, Github. I can utilize these strengths by helping with system administration set up and troubleshooting. The competency I want to develop further is incremental improvement. I plan to check with the team each day, and make sure we are all on the same page by verbal or written confirmation. I also want to strengthen my scripting and automation, and best networking practices and configuration.

__Gary King__ -Virtual Machines and AWS. Would like more practice in script writing.

__Nicco Evans__ - VMS, Networking, OS and software installation

__Elemo Mussa__ -

As a group we are strong with OS setup, and virtual machines, and we would like to collectively improve in scripting and automation.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

__Describe at least__:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

  - Take it to a vote and a group discussion.
  - If the team can not unanimously vote, then the PM will be the deciding vote, while still factoring in the team’s opinion.
  - In the event of a conflict requiring a vote, we agree it is better to have it written down. And some options of resolving it is providing pros and cons.
  - !!!!!!!!!!! EMERGENCY!!! CALL MARCOS OR TAS!!!!!!!

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Team discussions and decide together what tasks are assigned to each individual
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Patience
  - Collaboration

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

  - Team discussion, call their slacking out.
    - And one way to do this tactfully is to each day ask each person their goals for the day, and ask if they have any hurdles in their work, and how we can help them.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - *SEE EMERGENCY PLAN!* We will try to solve everything to the best of our ability, but if a team member has not contributed to their assigned tasks after 2 days we will need to escalate it to the instructional team.

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least

- What hours will you be available to communicate? *(3 CST, and 2 PST)*
  - We will all be available during normal class times of 9a-6pm PST, and we can send slack messages at any time, but will not expect a response unless during work times. (Unless the person wants to respond).
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack
- How often will you take breaks?
  - Agreed upon breaks are every 2 hours.
  - Dynamic breaking try to limit to 10 minutes. Sometimes we all need a breather or to step away from the computer to approach the problem fresh. And coffee refills.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - We should reach out for help.
    - Reach out to our team first.
    - Reach out to TA/Instructor if all else fail, or more than a day behind.
    - Look at our tasks and see if realistically and scope creeping.
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - Send through slack.
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  -Morning standup everyone speaks, and then after lunch we speak as a team. Work together to make sure no one is left behind.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - Don’t talk over each other.
  - Allow for different opinions.
  - Let people feel like they are contributing.
  - If someone is over speaking, or talking over someone, or making someone uncomfortable, anyone at any time can call a timeout.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

*NOTE:* While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

*Describe at least:*

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? We will use Trello and team discussion to assign tasks and keep track of completion. We can track individual contributions via Trello.
- What project management tool will be used?

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file. Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

## Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

*Daily meetup with Marco daily at 0930 in class Zoom
Thursday dry-run at 1100 (40 minutes)*

## Git Process

*Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.*

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
- What is your Git flow?
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
  - Who merges PRs?
  - How often will you merge?
  - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
