## Prepare for Projects: Systems Selection Document

This project will require you to demonstrate skills you’ve learned so far in the course.

## Project Requirements

Your instructor will provide the project guidelines and send you the scenario unique to your team. Some aspects of the project are left up to you to decide how to approach.

## Systems Selection

Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you’ll be using this project. Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.
Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’ve decided to work with this project. For each, explain:

- Due to time, we have scheduled Monday 9a-9:30a to write section 2 in more detail as a team. It is in Trello and tasked out.
  - VirtualBox, AWS, Ubuntu Server,  Google Documents

1. How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements? It will do the OS provisioning, the data backups, and documentation
2. What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?
   - The value it adds is they will have a secure and reliable linux based server. Also the setup will minimize system complexity and make it user friendly for non technical users. Also the detailed and relevant screenshots in the SOP will make it easy to transition the project to an internal IT team to maintain after completion.

3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
   - What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
      - Set up the Linux server, and Window OS, and email client, SOPs, and data backup.
